1. **Don't touch the DOM, I'll do it!**
	JavaScript manipulates the DOM, with ==React we don't need to directly interact with DOM== anymore. (Declarative rather than ~~Imperative~~)
2. **Build website like Lego Blocks**
	React has component architecture. That implies, ==react components are reusable==.
3. **Uni-directional Data Flow**
	VirtualDOM - Blueprint of how react should update the actual DOM.
	==Data only flows from Higher Component to a Lower Component.==
	That way it is easier to debug code.
4. Just UI, rest is upto you!
	Unlike Angular, ==React is just UI== and doesn't have all the tools that Angular/Angular-like framework has.

React Keywords:
*JSX, State, Components, Props, VirtualDOM, Declarative*

**Three Things for a Good React Developer:**
1. Decide on Components (to know how to break app into different components)
3. Decide the "State" and where it lives!
5. To know what changes when "State" changes?
